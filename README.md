# Gender-Classification-with-Tensorflow
Gender Classification with Tensorflow, DNN.
I crated simple DNN model by using tensorflow-keras with loss: 0.2538 - accuracy: 0.9095 - val_loss: 0.2799 - val_accuracy: 0.9254
I added the model file and model architecture with performance metrics.
I get the images from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cashutosh/gender-classification-dataset". If you set the pathways you can run the code blocks.
